# Sticky Images
Sticks images to your phone or tablet screen, quickly.

Intended for use by playback operators in film and television, Sticky Images does its best job to stubbornly display a given image or video to a device. Outside of the configuration screen, Sticky Images has no other interactive elements. Once an image is stuck, it's there until the app is killed or trimmed from memory.

Fair note: Sticky Images can only do so much. Android, for instance, has built in safeguards for the user that ensures that the navigation is always available. Nothing short of custom ROMs and Device Policy Control can ensure that an actor doesn't accidentally summon the navbar and escape the app, but neither of those options are viable for the typical drop-in-and-make-it-work situations that are common in playback.

Sticky Images is not a replacement for more a curated playback process that incorporates playlists, toggleable-chroma, and remote or keyboard cuing. Rather, it should be used for those times when you need to stick an image or video to the screen fast, and that's it. It'll work for basic chroma burnins, it'll work for ND setdec screens, it'll even work for basic callscreens.

Nifty Features:
- Select between Cover and Stretch fill modes.
    - Do you have content that's out of aspect ratio? The image will center-fit to the smallest dimension and overflow across the largest dimension, but you can also choose to let it stretch across the screen with distortion.
- Toggle-able proximity sensor blackout.
